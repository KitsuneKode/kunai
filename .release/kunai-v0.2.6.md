# Kunai 0.2.6

### Highlights

- **YouTube lane.** Search, playlists and channels play through the same shell as
  everything else, with live/upcoming handling, SponsorBlock and cookie settings,
  and video watch history counted in your stats.
- **Playback that recovers.** Persistent mpv sessions, provider fallback with
  endpoint-health diagnostics, and honest cancellation — a dead source retries
  the next one instead of looping.
- **Share links.** `kunai://` round trips, so a title (and timestamp) can be
  handed to someone else or reopened later.
- **Offline and downloads.** Downloaded episodes play through the same path as
  streamed ones, so resume, subtitles and history behave identically.
- **New surfaces.** Up Next queue, playlists, notifications, release calendar and
  a details sheet, plus a reworked settings shell.
- **Native installer.** Self-contained binaries with a versioned layout and
  channel-aware `kunai upgrade` / `kunai uninstall`.

### Before you upgrade

- YouTube playback needs `yt-dlp` on your `PATH`.
- Age-restricted YouTube content needs cookies you supply yourself.
- The provider relay stays user-owned — Kunai ships no shared public relay.
