# Kunai 0.3.0

Show posters on every terminal, including Windows.

- New half-block renderer decodes JPEG/PNG in process and paints two pixels per
  cell with truecolour SGR, so posters no longer require `chafa` — which is
  effectively never installed on Windows, where posters previously never
  appeared at all.
- Windows Terminal no longer auto-selects sixel: support only landed in 1.22 and
  the environment reports no version, so an older build rendered raw escape
  bytes. `KUNAI_IMAGE_PROTOCOL=sixel` still forces it.
- Poster cache moved onto the shared OS cache root (`getKunaiPaths`) instead of a
  hand-rolled `$HOME/.cache`, which is not a location Windows has.
- `KUNAI_IMAGE_PROTOCOL=half-block` forces the new renderer anywhere.

Playback reliability, calendar navigation, and shell responsiveness.

- Startup source failover walks the ordered source list before hopping providers, so a dead stream retries the next source instead of looping the same one.
- Resolve cancellation is honest end to end: abort reasons ride on the signal, late feedback from a cancelled resolve is dropped, and a stream that arrives after cancellation is never handed to mpv.
- Every exit routes through one phased shutdown coordinator with conventional exit codes (130/143/129), quiescing services and preserving playback, config, queue, and download state before disposal.
- Calendar navigation scrolls minimally instead of re-anchoring on every keypress, fixing the sliding rows and laggy arrows.
- The title-control menu (`m`) opens during playback instead of rendering underneath it, and cancel stays live across the whole bootstrap and failure window.
- The episode picker no longer collapses to a single entry when a provider listing fails or when continuing from history.
- Miruro resolves against the working mirrors only; Videasy reorders its first-phase servers and segment-probes HLS before attesting reachability.
- Search shows a query-aware loading skeleton, post-play artwork retries after a transient fetch failure, and quitting no longer pauses autoplay.
- Provider fallback moves to a deliberate `Shift+F` chord so a stray keypress cannot switch providers mid-session.

Harden installers and release asset completion checks.

- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` `--dry-run` / `-DryRun` compute paths without creating directories.
- Empty or incomplete release assets fail with specific messages and npm / Bun / source / pinned-version recovery guidance.
- GitHub Releases require all eight binaries plus `SHA256SUMS` (`fail_on_unmatched_files`, post-upload contract assertion).

Ship the npm postinstall registration hook in the published tarball and verify a clean global install, update check, and package-manager uninstall.
