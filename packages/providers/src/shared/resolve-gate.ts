/**
 * The one way a provider proves a candidate is playable before reporting success.
 *
 * **It takes the candidate, not a URL plus separately-assembled headers.** That
 * is the whole point. Videasy verified a stream with `Origin: vidking.net` and
 * shipped the same URL with `Origin: cineby.at`; the CDN accepted the first and
 * refused the second, so the gate attested a request shape production never
 * made and cycling stopped at a source that could not play. Passing the
 * candidate makes the probed shape and the shipped shape the same object.
 *
 * Only a *definitive* refusal rejects. A timeout, a non-definitive error, or a
 * skipped probe is not evidence of a dead stream — treating it as one trades a
 * working source for a slow link, and playback preflight still runs before mpv
 * receives the handoff.
