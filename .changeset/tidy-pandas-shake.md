Playback reliability, calendar navigation, and shell responsiveness.

- Startup source failover walks the ordered source list before hopping providers, so a dead stream retries the next source instead of looping the same one.
- Resolve cancellation is honest end to end: abort reasons ride on the signal, late feedback from a cancelled resolve is dropped, and a stream that arrives after cancellation is never handed to mpv.
- Every exit routes through one phased shutdown coordinator with conventional exit codes (130/143/129), quiescing services and preserving playback, config, queue, and download state before disposal.
- Calendar navigation scrolls minimally instead of re-anchoring on every keypress, fixing the sliding rows and laggy arrows.
- The title-control menu (`m`) opens during playback instead of rendering underneath it, and cancel stays live across the whole bootstrap and failure window.
- The episode picker no longer collapses to a single entry when a provider listing fails or when continuing from history.
- Miruro resolves against the working mirrors only; Videasy reorders its first-phase servers and segment-probes HLS before attesting reachability.
- Search shows a query-aware loading skeleton, post-play artwork retries after a transient fetch failure, and quitting no longer pauses autoplay.
- Provider fallback moves to a deliberate `Shift+F` chord so a stray keypress cannot switch providers mid-session.
