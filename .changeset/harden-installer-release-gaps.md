Harden installers and release asset completion checks.

- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` `--dry-run` / `-DryRun` compute paths without creating directories.
- Empty or incomplete release assets fail with specific messages and npm / Bun / source / pinned-version recovery guidance.
- GitHub Releases require all eight binaries plus `SHA256SUMS` (`fail_on_unmatched_files`, post-upload contract assertion).
