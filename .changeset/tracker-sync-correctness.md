Rebuild tracker sync on a generation-safe SQLite outbox with typed tracker
identities and idempotent desired-state writes, so a redelivery converges
instead of toggling and a late completion cannot overwrite newer intent.

AniList now connects with no configuration at all: the implicit grant needs no
client secret, so Kunai ships an application id and nothing else. Delivery is
paced against AniList's published rate-limit headers, and a `429` defers the
whole batch for that tracker using the server's own wait rather than retrying
into it. Sync can be paused for a while — distinct from turning a tracker off —
with work still queueing while paused.

Favourites and watchlist now reach the right tracker. A list change carries the
title's catalogue ids instead of dropping them, and AniList is resolved from an
explicit id rather than from the lane a row arrived through — anime almost always
arrives as a TMDB-typed `series`, so the old lane check rejected the very titles
it existed to route while TMDB accepted them. Favouriting an anime wrote to TMDB
and never to AniList; more often it queued nothing at all and still reported
success. A title no tracker can address now says so instead of looking identical
to one that synced, and AniList takes precedence over TMDB when both resolve, so
one keypress files one title in one account.

Every TMDB write was rejected as unauthenticated: the adapter sent the v3 API key
as a bearer token and invented an `X-Session-Id` header, then addressed the
account by username. Auth moves to the query string TMDB v3 documents, the
numeric account id addresses the account, and an identity stored under the old
shape is repaired on next start rather than needing a reconnect.

Fixes several silent failures: removing a title from a watchlist reported
success when the lookup had actually been rejected; `ToggleFavourite` could fire
after an unreadable lookup, turning a redelivery into a flip-flop; TMDB's
"push watched" removed titles from the watchlist; validation errors retried
forever instead of dead-lettering; and an offline start silently unlinked a
connected AniList account. Permanently undeliverable changes are now reported on
the sync page, which previously read "up to date" while they sat there.

List membership is a set again: `(list_id, title_id)` is unique, so adding a
title twice keeps one row instead of two invisible ones, and the membership check
gets a covering index. Existing duplicates collapse onto the earliest row.

In the shell, the favourite mark moves to its own accent-tinted column on the
right — prefixed into the title it took the title's colour and pushed every
favourited row a glyph out of alignment — and a toggle now reports which way it
went, and where it synced, instead of "Updated favourites" for both directions.
Favourites reach the screens where you actually spend time: `l` toggles during
loading and playback, and the playing rail and post-play panel both show the
mark. The details panel gained a Favourite line beside Watchlist, which had
been describing one half of a pair.

Connecting TMDB no longer hangs when the API is unreachable. Artwork and
metadata try a mirror before going direct, so they can work on a network where
account linking cannot — linking must be direct, because a request token and
session id are account credentials. That now fails in seconds with an
explanation instead of stalling forever with no output.

Sync gains a settings page — the first reachable Connect surface — with a status
badge in the root crumb. It is marked experimental: the delivery path is covered
by tests but has not yet been verified against a live tracker account.
