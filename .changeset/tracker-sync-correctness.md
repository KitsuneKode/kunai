Rebuild tracker sync on a generation-safe SQLite outbox with typed tracker
identities and idempotent desired-state writes, so a redelivery converges
instead of toggling and a late completion cannot overwrite newer intent.

AniList now connects with no configuration at all: the implicit grant needs no
client secret, so Kunai ships an application id and nothing else. Delivery is
paced against AniList's published rate-limit headers, and a `429` defers the
whole batch for that tracker using the server's own wait rather than retrying
into it. Sync can be paused for a while — distinct from turning a tracker off —
with work still queueing while paused.

Fixes several silent failures: removing a title from a watchlist reported
success when the lookup had actually been rejected; `ToggleFavourite` could fire
after an unreadable lookup, turning a redelivery into a flip-flop; TMDB's
"push watched" removed titles from the watchlist; validation errors retried
forever instead of dead-lettering; and an offline start silently unlinked a
connected AniList account.

Sync gains a settings page — the first reachable Connect surface — with a status
badge in the root crumb. It is marked experimental: the delivery path is covered
by tests but has not yet been verified against a live tracker account.
